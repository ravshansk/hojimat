#+TITLE: General notes

* ACE Modeling Principles

** Real world economics has 5 properties:
1. Heterogeneous interactive participants
   They have local states: data, attributes, methods
2. Open-ended dynamic systems.
3. Participants are strategic decision makers
   They take into account past and future
4. Participants are locally constructive
5. System reflexivity
   Past actions affect future states

** 7 properties of ACE:
1. Agent definition
2. Agent scope
3. Agent local constructivity
4. Agent autonomy
5. System constructivity
6. System historicity
7. Modeler as Culture-Dish experimenter

Modeler gives initial conditions and steps back. Any stochasticity must come only from the agents (like weather/nature). 

** ACE research objectives:
1. Empirical understanding
2. Normative design
3. Qualitative insight and theory generation
4. Tool advancement

I want to excel in tool advancement. 

* All link listings and descriptions

** Empirical validation
Input, process, descriptive, predictive validation are the focus.
